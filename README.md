Final Project Deliverable for 4155 

Group #8: Hunter Carlton, Ray Evans, Jared Garris, Riley Hood and Lukas Newman 

Project Title: Miner Munchies

Instructions to run: Since we are using a database for our web based application, we are using node.ejs. 
To start: Simply open a terminal and cd into the MinerMunchies folder. Then run the application by 'node app.js'
The application will then run on your localhost on port 8001

We created a web based application intended for students, faculty, and guests of UNC Charlotte when on campus. Miner Munchies is a centralized hub for our target audience to find and compare food options on campus. Miner Munchies allows users to find on campus restaurants and vending machines. We also implemented a user account feature, which allows the user to either create a new account or login to a previous one. With the help of our database, users are able to save favorite restaurants, provide feedback, and rate their experience for other users.
